## About The Project

Here is the code of the project for all that want to see more. PHP and images are excluded for safety measurement. It still needs some work, but it is already showable. If you want you can run the site on (<a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/">https://pagespeed.web.dev</a>). The project started out of a course of my studies. 


Here's why you should hire me:

- Good knowledge and skill about web developing, not perfect but very good 
- Strong work ethic
- You need more? Let's talk and find out what I can do for you
